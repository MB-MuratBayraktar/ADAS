# ADAS
ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) is a program that assists the driver during the trip by analyzing pedestrians movements and drivers actions

In this repo, I am applying detectron2 to analyze the movement of pedestrains infront of vehicles and notify whenever they are too close in proximity.

The project will be updated continuosly to add more features as below:
 
 ✅ track the linear distance of pedestrians on realtime. 
 
 ⬛ count the encountered instances and save in a log file
 
 ⬛ Detect drowsiness & analyze the action of the driver using keypoints
 
 ⬛ Detect smoking by driver
 
 
 Below you can see the first objective successfully done:
